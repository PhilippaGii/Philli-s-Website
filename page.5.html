  <p class="questions">->How did it feel to publish your first book at 19 years?</p>
  <p>Honestly it feels so good. I feel like I can inspire a lot of young people to share their thoughts and stories with the world. I also reached one of my goals after fighting for nearly a decade. Honestly, it is the best thing.</p>
  <p class="questions">->What is your next move?</p>
  <p>I think for now, let me take baby steps. I want also focus on my degree and work and reach my full potential regarding software engineering. Then, I will move to the next project.</p>
  <p class="questions">->What is your next book?</p>
  <p>The next book is called Burn for Me.</p>
  <p class="questions">->Is 'Back to Black' based on a true story?</p>
  <p>It is somewhat based on a true story. It is a little related to events that happened to some of my friends, that happened to me and then the rest is fictional. Most of my books have at least one thing that somewhat traces back to me.</p>
  <p class="questions">->Which part did you enjoy writing about the most in 'Back to Black'?</p>
  <p>One of the parts was the allergic reaction to black pepper as it is something I myself could relate to.</p>
